# Exercise for Mobile Application Development

## To Do
- [x] Remove magic number from MainActivity.SectionsPagerAdapter.
- [ ] Test and commit.
- [ ] Refactor PastaFragment, PizzaFragment, and StoresFragment by moving common code into a new abstract superclass. 
- [ ] Test and commit.
- [ ] Add another screen (e.g., AppetizerFragment). 
- [ ] Test and commit.

Challenge:  
- [ ] Improve MainActivity.SectionsPagerAdapter (possibly moving code elsewhere).
- [ ] Add a string-array named tabs to strings.xml that lists the tab titles in order.
- [ ] Rewrite getPageTitle() to eliminate magic numbers and use tabs to determine order.

Double challenge:  
- [ ] Ditto for getItem()
